This makes possible the construction of larger more complex IT systems.</p>\n<p>It is important to appreciate that the essence of this module is internalising the formula and systems for creating mission impact with software. It’s going to make you a professional software engineer with savvy business awareness.</p>\n<p>Whilst we learn about these abstract ideas and concepts it is essential that you make them come to life by applying them back to your own experiences and business environment.</p>\n","<h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT-jjCXgRttr3Iup8KVPz1sja4uIYeMoPwim0YQsDF3eoXyjoC1Cu8vXsDHQxDootrmR4oIsFmTYm6b/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"444\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>Frameworks are abstract structures to help support our understand of complex systems.

Our task in the module is to learn the labels, learn the patterns, understand the outputs of the SDLC and apply it to our own experiences.</p>\n<h2>Learn these</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/74645922-ba2e3980-5170-11ea-9f62-0fa8f6d594e0.jpg\" alt=\"SDLC\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feasibility Study</li>\n<li>Requirements Engineering</li>\n<li>Design</li>\n<li>Development</li>\n<li>Testing</li>\n<li>Implementation</li>\n<li>Maintenance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Memorise these 7 stages of the SDLC. You will see variations of these on-line and in literature. These are the 7 terms that BCS use so we are going to use them.</p>\n<h2>Inputs &amp; Outputs</h2>\n<p>What follows is a brief overview of the different inputs and outputs for each stage of the SDLC. At the end of this module you should be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognise that there are several ways to represent the terminology and stages of the SDLC.</li>\n<li>Describe the role of the SDLC in the context of developing of IT systems and services, and operational software end-products.</li>\n<li>Explain the purpose of the SDLC as a means to facilitate the creation of effective software.</li>\n</ul>\n","<h1>Feasibility Study</h1>\n<p>The inputs for the feasibility study are business needs. At the end of this section you should be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain how software development is initiated when a need or an opportunity is identified.</li>\n<li>Describe the purpose and main activities of a feasibility study, including:\n<ul>\n<li>technical feasibility</li>\n<li>financial feasibility</li>\n<li>collection of information</li>\n<li>assessment of risks and implications</li>\n<li>consideration of alternatives</li>\n<li>feasibility report writing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Explain why it is important to plan software development.</li>\n<li>Explain the purpose of a business case.</li>\n<li>Describe potential tangible and intangible benefits that can be achieved using operational software, including:\n<ul>\n<li>cost savings</li>\n<li>productivity gains</li>\n<li>risk reduction</li>\n<li>time savings</li>\n<li>increased income</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Demonstrate a simple cost benefit analysis for a given case.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTT3P1ioBFXXr7u0hNMmx03XYMMydTxmYJ7GUS0IK6lxySP9O-3fobzpAjV8cjY2uNm2KlzVJkrye-I/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"444\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n<h2>Inputs</h2>\n<p>The initial input to the SDLC can come from a number of different places.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market forces from competitors</li>\n<li>New technologies</li>\n<li>Changes in regulations</li>\n<li>Identifying a gap in the market</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This first phase of the SDLC looks at the aims of the business and the environment that it is operating in and asks the question “what should we be doing to fulfil our aims?”.</p>\n<p>That might be reacting to competitors. For example modern banking apps like Monzo and Starling introduced the ability to freeze a debit card from an app. Other banks saw this and reacted to the competition by implementing this same feature for their own customers. This is an example of a SDLC being driven by business needs.</p>\n<p>During the feasibility study executive staff figure out what their organisation should do next. This period of research and decision making is often dominated by the economic principle of <strong>Return on Investment</strong> (ROI).</p>\n<h3>Return on Investment</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Return on investment (ROI) is a ratio between net profit (over a period) and cost of investment (resulting from an investment of some resources at a point in time). A high ROI means the investment’s gains compare favourably to its cost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To become more familiar with this concept can you work your way through these two examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> A new (fourth) lane on the M1 is to be constructed. The costs and benefits of this road are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>£7.5million reduction in accidents calculated from life insurance values</li>\n<li>£3.2million in planning applications</li>\n<li>£2million in time-saving calculated from leisure preferences</li>\n<li>£6.5million in materials</li>\n<li>£6million for labour</li>\n<li>£3.5million for displacement of households</li>\n<li>£11million in time-savings calculated from wages</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<section id=\"W3FdIFRoZSBjb3N0IGJlbmVmaXQgcmF0aW8gaXMgKHJvdW5kZWQgdG8gMiBkZWNpbWFsIHBsYWNlcyk=\" class=\"scorm-quiz\">\n                <article class=\"scorm-quiz-question noselect\">The cost benefit ratio is (rounded to 2 decimal places)</article>\n                <article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIDAuOTc=\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBUaGUgY29zdCBiZW5lZml0IHJhdGlvIGlzIChyb3VuZGVkIHRvIDIgZGVjaW1hbCBwbGFjZXMpJywgJ1sgXSAwLjk3JywgJ1sjXSAxLjA3J119')\">0.97</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyNdIDEuMDc=\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBUaGUgY29zdCBiZW5lZml0IHJhdGlvIGlzIChyb3VuZGVkIHRvIDIgZGVjaW1hbCBwbGFjZXMpJywgJ1sjXSAxLjA3JywgJ1sjXSAxLjA3J119')\">1.07</article>\n            </section></p>\n<p>\n<section id=\"W3FdIEdpdmVuIHRoZSBjb3N0IGJlbmVmaXQgcmF0aW8gb2YgdGhlIGFib3ZlIHNob3VsZCB5b3UgZ28gYWhlYWQgd2l0aCB0aGUgNHRoIGxhbmU/\" class=\"scorm-quiz\">\n                <article class=\"scorm-quiz-question noselect\">Given the cost benefit ratio of the above should you go ahead with the 4th lane?</article>\n                <article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyNdIFlFUw==\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBHaXZlbiB0aGUgY29zdCBiZW5lZml0IHJhdGlvIG9mIHRoZSBhYm92ZSBzaG91bGQgeW91IGdvIGFoZWFkIHdpdGggdGhlIDR0aCBsYW5lPycsICdbI10gWUVTJywgJ1sjXSBZRVMnXX0=')\">YES</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIE5P\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBHaXZlbiB0aGUgY29zdCBiZW5lZml0IHJhdGlvIG9mIHRoZSBhYm92ZSBzaG91bGQgeW91IGdvIGFoZWFkIHdpdGggdGhlIDR0aCBsYW5lPycsICdbIF0gTk8nLCAnWyNdIFlFUyddfQ==')\">NO</article>\n            </section></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> A financial technology startup is expanding and adding two new programmers.

Why these fields? Where is the input data used? or analysis screen grabs and dissect components. They might also want to know things like how many invoices are filed in a month? How many automated emails sent? When is the system at capacity? Volumetric information like this can help the analysis.</p>\n<h3>Activity sampling</h3>\n<p>To perform <strong>“Activity sampling”</strong> you do the following: At different times (to generate a fair sample) visit a location or office floor and record what each person is doing.

We need to decide what we should do with those inputs, for example they may need processing, or storing. Then we can design a way to access the outputs for the requirements.</p>\n<p>For example we might collect the email and password in a web form, send those inputs to our server. The server can store those inputs (when creating an account), or process them (when logging in). Logging in or creating a session is our first output the server takes an email and password and returns a new session.</p>\n<h3>Use case diagram</h3>\n<p>Use case diagrams are a way to express all these inputs and outputs. These diagrams can help designers to express their input output design.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75772283-8ee84480-5d43-11ea-9c95-defd5db09005.jpg\" alt=\"use case diagram\"></p>\n<p>In the rectangle are the requirements. Around the rectangle are different types of users who either provide inputs or consume outputs. What is interesting about the diagram are the places when the line from a user to a requirement crosses the edge of the rectangle. These intersections are the places that need input output design.</p>\n<h3>UI</h3>\n<p>Considering the diagram above can you describe one of the forms that you might need to design? Include in your description the kinds of data your form would have to collect and what might happen to that data.</p>\n<h2>Process Design</h2>\n<p>To realise requirements sometimes you need to combine a series of processes together. This is process design. Following on from our order system we have just been looking at:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75778926-9feb8280-5d50-11ea-8179-519a861ecf95.jpg\" alt=\"process diagram\"></p>\n<p>In this example the website is a simple static site hosted on <a href=\"https://surge.sh\">surge</a>, the organisation runs its own bespoke accounting software solution on its own servers. The databases are hosted on AWS (amazon web services) and exposed via a RESTful API. Authentication of http requests is done via a dedicated service which is also hosted on AWS.</p>\n<p>To place an order this is the process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A user requests the website hosted on surge</li>\n<li>Surge responds with the website index page</li>\n<li>From the website a request with items to order is sent to an Auth service on AWS</li>\n<li>That Auth service validates the request then forwards the order onto the API</li>\n<li>The API processes the order by reading and writing to the databases</li>\n<li>The API responds to the request with a status</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A user will be free to select items. Then they will be able to place an order. If they are logged in and have an active session then we will create an Order record, and update the Users orders collection.</p>\n<h3>High level to lower level</h3>\n<p>Our process design at the moment is quite high level, we can now go into more and more detail as we design the system in more and more detail.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/5MHFuFtdsKENi/giphy.gif\" alt=\"fractal\"></p>\n<p>For example in the diagram above we have an Authentication step in our process. That might need a more detailed design. Below is an activity diagram that shows how to handle incoming requests.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75785433-a16e7800-5d5b-11ea-9edc-405fb8d53d29.jpg\" alt=\"activity diagram\"></p>\n<h2>Data</h2>\n<p>Next we might want to start thinking about our data structures. In OO (object orientated) programming our data structures are mirrored in code and in the datastore. For example our program might have an <strong>Order</strong> class that we interact with in our program, and each instance of an <strong>Order</strong> is also persisted as a row in a datastore.</p>\n<p>Data design starts with the requirements. Once it is clear what needs to be persisted often data is then <strong><em>normalised</em></strong>.</p>\n<h3>Normalisation</h3>\n<p>This is a technique in data design. The aim is redundancy-free data structures. That means data structures that…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>do not contain data that can be derived</li>\n<li>only contain one copy of each logical point</li>\n<li>contain the very latest value for each data item</li>\n<li>combine items into logical groups based on underlaying data dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A good example of normalisation is the way we can store a one-to-many relationship in a relational database. For example our Customers will have many orders. To normalise that data structure we should store the Customer once. Then use their id in the Orders table to create that relationship.</p>\n<h1>👨🏽‍🎓 Design brief</h1>\n<p>Design what you think would be a good starting point for the data in our ordering system. Create your designs using UML. When you have finished you should upload your work <a href=\"https://applied.whitehat.org.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=7120&amp;action=editsubmission\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://applied.whitehat.org.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=7120&action=editsubmission\" target=\"_Blank\" style=\"display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;padding:2rem;background-color:rgba(37,221,156,0.1);cursor:default;text-decoration:none;\"><button style=\"border-width:0;padding:.5rem 1rem;background-color:var(--wh-green);color:white;border-radius:3px;box-shadow:1px 1px 3px -2px black;cursor:pointer;\" type=\"button\">Data Design Assignment</button></a></p>\n<h2>Security and control design</h2>\n<p>These are the mechanisms we design to ensure the system has integrity. The safeguards we introduce for the inputs and outputs of our system. For example; validating inputs from the user. Restricting write access to certain tables. Restricting read access for certain users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75792946-9240f780-5d66-11ea-9183-389a2758c527.jpg\" alt=\"ordering system\"></p>\n<p>\n<section id=\"W3FdIEluIG91ciBvcmRlcmluZyBzeXN0ZW0gYWJvdmUgd2hpY2ggcGFydCBvZiB0aGUgZGVzaWduIGlzIHJlc3BvbnNpYmxlIGZvciBzZWN1cml0eSBhbmQgY29udHJvbD8=\" class=\"scorm-quiz\">\n                <article class=\"scorm-quiz-question noselect\">In our ordering system above which part of the design is responsible for security and control?</article>\n                <article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIEN1c3RvbWVycw==\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBJbiBvdXIgb3JkZXJpbmcgc3lzdGVtIGFib3ZlIHdoaWNoIHBhcnQgb2YgdGhlIGRlc2lnbiBpcyByZXNwb25zaWJsZSBmb3Igc2VjdXJpdHkgYW5kIGNvbnRyb2w/JywgJ1sgXSBDdXN0b21lcnMnLCAnWyNdIEF1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9uJ119')\">Customers</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIEFjY291bnRz\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBJbiBvdXIgb3JkZXJpbmcgc3lzdGVtIGFib3ZlIHdoaWNoIHBhcnQgb2YgdGhlIGRlc2lnbiBpcyByZXNwb25zaWJsZSBmb3Igc2VjdXJpdHkgYW5kIGNvbnRyb2w/JywgJ1sgXSBBY2NvdW50cycsICdbI10gQXV0aGVudGljYXRpb24nXX0=')\">Accounts</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIFdlYnNpdGU=\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBJbiBvdXIgb3JkZXJpbmcgc3lzdGVtIGFib3ZlIHdoaWNoIHBhcnQgb2YgdGhlIGRlc2lnbiBpcyByZXNwb25zaWJsZSBmb3Igc2VjdXJpdHkgYW5kIGNvbnRyb2w/JywgJ1sgXSBXZWJzaXRlJywgJ1sjXSBBdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbiddfQ==')\">Website</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIEFjY291bnRpbmc=\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBJbiBvdXIgb3JkZXJpbmcgc3lzdGVtIGFib3ZlIHdoaWNoIHBhcnQgb2YgdGhlIGRlc2lnbiBpcyByZXNwb25zaWJsZSBmb3Igc2VjdXJpdHkgYW5kIGNvbnRyb2w/JywgJ1sgXSBBY2NvdW50aW5nJywgJ1sjXSBBdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbiddfQ==')\">Accounting</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyNdIEF1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9u\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBJbiBvdXIgb3JkZXJpbmcgc3lzdGVtIGFib3ZlIHdoaWNoIHBhcnQgb2YgdGhlIGRlc2lnbiBpcyByZXNwb25zaWJsZSBmb3Igc2VjdXJpdHkgYW5kIGNvbnRyb2w/JywgJ1sjXSBBdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbicsICdbI10gQXV0aGVudGljYXRpb24nXX0=')\">Authentication</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIEFQSQ==\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBJbiBvdXIgb3JkZXJpbmcgc3lzdGVtIGFib3ZlIHdoaWNoIHBhcnQgb2YgdGhlIGRlc2lnbiBpcyByZXNwb25zaWJsZSBmb3Igc2VjdXJpdHkgYW5kIGNvbnRyb2w/JywgJ1sgXSBBUEknLCAnWyNdIEF1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9uJ119')\">API</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIFVzZXJz\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBJbiBvdXIgb3JkZXJpbmcgc3lzdGVtIGFib3ZlIHdoaWNoIHBhcnQgb2YgdGhlIGRlc2lnbiBpcyByZXNwb25zaWJsZSBmb3Igc2VjdXJpdHkgYW5kIGNvbnRyb2w/JywgJ1sgXSBVc2VycycsICdbI10gQXV0aGVudGljYXRpb24nXX0=')\">Users</article><article class=\"scorm-quiz-answer noselect\" id=\"WyBdIE9yZGVycw==\" onclick=\"onAnswer('KCkgPT4ge3JldHVybiBbJ1txXSBJbiBvdXIgb3JkZXJpbmcgc3lzdGVtIGFib3ZlIHdoaWNoIHBhcnQgb2YgdGhlIGRlc2lnbiBpcyByZXNwb25zaWJsZSBmb3Igc2VjdXJpdHkgYW5kIGNvbnRyb2w/JywgJ1sgXSBPcmRlcnMnLCAnWyNdIEF1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9uJ119')\">Orders</article>\n            </section></p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>Let us now consider the design phase in the context agile and waterfall software development methodologies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Methodology</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Design notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75794619-f2d13400-5d68-11ea-97ea-85e4a63a720f.jpg\" alt=\"waterfall\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><h3>Waterfall</h3><p>In the waterfall method all the design work is done before the developers start to write any code.

Address the five points above and relate them to your role and times you have used these features.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Release Management</h2>\n<p>Throughout the software development process, your code will go through cycles of development, testing, and fixing. Depending on your team, technology, platform, and other variables, you’ll likely have several environments that you use to manage your application. 1 In order to effectively test and release software, it’s imperative to have a simple and reliable release process for getting your code onto your various environments.</p>\n<p>Your options for release management are literally endless. You could write your own scripts entirely from scratch or lean on tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, GoCD or TeamCity.</p>\n<p>If it’s difficult to release code, you won’t release as frequently, and you may end up facing difficult choices where you need to release an update but fear disrupting your customers or acting to quickly. With a good release process, you should be incredibly confident releasing updates with no interruption to your customers. The best rule of thumb to know if your release process is good is whether you get anxious when releasing updates. That anxiety is often a symptom of a lack of confidence in your processes, and you should probably spend some time streamlining your releases.</p>\n<p>Beyond the necessary side of getting your code where it needs to be, one of the biggest benefits of good release management is the ability to rollback in the event of an emergency. No matter how finely tuned your development and release process is, you’ll occasionally have hiccups in production.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/o0g6oez12yl01.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d031a34a6f86ebabf21a75155b3dba3b25216958\" alt=\"rollback broken code\"></p>\n<p>When this happens, you’ll want to be able to easily rollback to your previously released codebase without breaking anything. This way, you’re not forced to rush an ill-considered fix out the door. Instead, you just rollback so that you can resolve the issue without affecting customers and then release again when it’s ready.</p>\n<p>You might also have different environments that you deploy to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development</li>\n<li>Staging</li>\n<li>QA testers</li>\n<li>Production</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Continuous deployment</h3>\n<p>Continuous deployment is one of the most advanced setups for team that have quality and process locked down. In these situations, releases are set up to happen automatically if new code successfully passes all of the automated tests. In order to do this, your team has to have an incredibly level of confidence that new code is tested and working. In this scenario, whenever someone adds new code, it will be run through all of your automated tests and, assuming they pass, put the code into production.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>📄</h1>\n<p>Write a piece in your portfolio that explains the coding guidelines and standards that you have to follow (i.e. code must have tests, code lint rules etc). You should also explain the process of peer reviews and retrospectives that you have to follow in your team.</p>\n<h1>👩‍💻🧑‍💻</h1>\n<p>In pairs explain the purpose of a range of programming tools, including compilers; interpreters; debuggers; GUI designers.</p>\n<h1>💻</h1>\n<p>Take one of your repositories that is currently in version control (this should be a personal project). Can you implement a release management strategy for your project? Merging or pushing to master should trigger tests and a deployment.</p>\n<h1>Outputs</h1>\n<p>The output of the development phase is untested working software.</p>\n","<h1>Testing</h1>\n<p>This section will cover the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 3 reasons why we test code</li>\n<li>The 7 Principles of Software Testing</li>\n<li>4 Different types of testing</li>\n<li>6 Different techniques of testing</li>\n<li>What equivalence classes and use cases are</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Inputs</h1>\n<p>The input for the testing phase is untested software.</p>\n<h2>Why Test?</h2>\n<p>The purpose of testing software is to remove</p>\n<h3>Errors</h3>\n<h3>Defects</h3>\n<h3>Failures</h3>\n<p>Errors caused by code that is incorrectly implemented. Defects caused by code that works, but does not work in the way it is intended too. Failures cause your software to stop working all together.

For example 15 fields in a form that can each take one of 5 possible values would required 30,517,578,125 unit tests to prove each combination. Please don’t do that.

A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object. Unit tests are static tests (see below).</p>\n<h3>Integration Testing</h3>\n<p>Integration tests determine if independently developed units of software work correctly when they are connected to each other. These tests often assert behaviours, and can be static or dynamic. For example calling this endpoint;</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs\">/users/x023/photos\n</code></pre>\n<p>should return a JSON string with an array of urls. This is testing that the server correctly interacts with the database and returns the correct values.</p>\n<h3>System Testing</h3>\n<p>The whole system is run. This is a dynamic test. Examples of system testing are end-to-end tests; automated, codified interactions (see <a href=\"https://www.cypress.io/\">cypress.io</a>) with assertions of state or outputs. Other examples of system testing include;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>load testing</li>\n<li>penetration testing (PEN testing)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

Think PASS/FAIL. On a form functional input might be a checkbox.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-functional testing</strong> is NOT binary, it requires more explanation. Think FEELINGS? On a form non-functional input might be a free text field inviting your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Both of these are important to test for.</p>\n<h2>Equivalence classes and Use Cases</h2>\n<p>One of the seven principles of testing is <strong>exhaustive testing is impossible</strong>. So how should we go about testing our applications? The answer is to use equivalence classes.</p>\n<p>Say we have an input field that is designed to take the number of tickets you can book for a concert. One individual can buy upto 10 tickets. We want to test this. For example</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selecting -2 tickets is not a valid amount</li>\n<li>Selecting 11 tickets is not a valid amount</li>\n<li>Selecting 6 tickets is OK</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can divide up the range of possible values like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/79448889-23e48b80-7fda-11ea-8397-96a67b7165b5.png\" alt=\"equivalence classes example\"></p>\n<p>What emerges are four “classes” of tests that are created by the different ranges of valid and invalid possible inputs.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>negative numbers <span style=\"color:red;\">FAIL</span></li>\n<li>zero <span style=\"color:red;\">FAIL</span></li>\n<li>valid amount 1 - 10 <span style=\"color:green;\">PASS</span></li>\n<li>out of range values <span style=\"color:red;\">FAIL</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We only need one test in each class because, testing that 6 is OK would be equivalent to testing 7 is OK. They are both valid amounts, the result of the test would be the same or equivalent. There is no point in testing in this class more than once because the results are equal or equivalent. Same for the out of range values, we tested with 11, but would expect the same results for 50, 100, 1000 etc</p>\n<h3>Boundary Value Analysis</h3>\n<p>We could also do some <strong>boundary value analysis</strong> by testing the boundaries of our values as defined in our equivalence classes. For example let us set a lower limit of -99, and an upper limit of 99. Then we might have a set of tests for the following values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-99</li>\n<li>-1</li>\n<li>0</li>\n<li>1</li>\n<li>10</li>\n<li>11</li>\n<li>99</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Can you see we test the values at each boundary? The min and max possible values as identified by our equivalence classes.</p>\n<h3>Use cases (test cases)</h3>\n<p>Use cases apply the same idea as equivalence classes, but scaled up and applied to a whole system. Below you can see a diagram of a system. Carefully selected user journeys are put together so that every part of the application is tested.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/79450177-7b83f680-7fdc-11ea-9f55-8fe1c7361de4.gif\" alt=\"use case example\"></p>\n<p>Can you see how each test lights up a different part of the application. One of those tests is a use-case, together they form a set of test cases. These test cases test the whole application (not exhaustively) section by section.</p>\n<h1>Outputs</h1>\n<p>The output of the testing phase is fully tested software.</p>\n<p>Can you explain in your

This can take the form of either 1st, 2nd or 3rd line support. Often this kind of support is managed by a system. Let us have a look at how it works.</p>\n<h3>1st line support</h3>\n<p>Usually a first point of contact when a bug or error is detected. This might be over the phone for example. Often this involves raising a ticket on a system so that your reported incident can be tracked. There may be quick solutions offered for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“have you tried turning it off and on again?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>2nd line support</h3>\n<p>This is usually more involved and often a support professional with domain knowledge will try to solve the problem. This typically involves on-site visits or remote sessions. 2nd line support technicians might escalate a something they are unable to fix to 3rd line support.</p>\n<h3>3rd line support</h3>\n<p>This level involves the experts. These are the people who actually wrote the software or the network engineers who actually installed a network.</p>\n<h1>When things go wrong</h1>\n<p>It happens. Sometimes software breaks in production.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmjDwNe0BcE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p>Bad. However RBS was able to find what caused the problem. In the following section we are going to learn about 4 different kinds of structured problem solving techniques.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brainstorming</li>\n<li>Fault tree analysis</li>\n<li>Ishakawa (fishbone) diagrams</li>\n<li>Kepner-Tregoe “Root cause analysis”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Brainstorming</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/80510926-4e87fa00-8973-11ea-8aca-7d5911bd402e.png\" alt=\"brainstorming\"></p>\n<p>This is the more informal kind of problem solving and often a starting point. Members of the team pile in ideas as to what have caused a failure. There is no particular structure or order. A collection of possibilities is an easy first step a can then help a team decide what to focus on next.</p>\n<h2>Fault tree analysis</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/80510929-50ea5400-8973-11ea-9be6-3525b691e373.png\" alt=\"fault tree analysis\"></p>\n<p>Fault tree analysis is a top-down approach to identify all potential causes leading to a defect. Each cause is further broken down into least possible events or faults. The analysis begins with a major defect. All the potential events – individual or in combination – that may cause the defect are identified. Potential events are further traced down in a similar way to the lowest possible level.</p>\n<h2>Ishakawa (fishbone) diagrams</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/80510935-534cae00-8973-11ea-9843-db6da42e890b.png\" alt=\"Ishakawa (fishbone) diagrams\"></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLvizyDFLQ4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p>How to make your own:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agree on a problem statement (effect). Write it at the center right of the flipchart or whiteboard. Draw a box around it and draw a horizontal arrow running to it.</li>\n<li>Brainstorm the major categories of causes of the problem. If this is difficult use generic headings:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Methods</li>\n<li>Machines (equipment)</li>\n<li>People (manpower)</li>\n<li>Materials</li>\n<li>Measurement</li>\n<li>Environment</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Write the categories of causes as branches from the main arrow.</li>\n<li>Brainstorm all the possible causes of the problem. Ask “Why does this happen?” As each idea is given, the facilitator writes it as a branch from the appropriate category. Causes can be written in several places if they relate to several categories.</li>\n<li>Again ask “Why does this happen?” about each cause. Write sub-causes branching off the causes. Continue to ask “Why?” and generate deeper levels of causes. Layers of branches indicate causal relationships.</li>\n<li>When the group runs out of ideas, focus attention to places on the chart where ideas are few.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Kepner-Tregoe “Root cause analysis”</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Type</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Analysis</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Situational Analysis</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Clarify the situation, outline concerns and choose a direction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Problem Analysis</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Define the problem and determine its root cause.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Decision Analysis</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Identify alternatives and perform a risk analysis for each one.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Potential Problem Analysis</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">The best of the alternatives is further scrutinised against negative consequences and actions are proposed to minimise the risk.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>⚠️ warning this this video contains footage of a tragic event in which people died.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nspP1YFftAY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<h1>👩‍💻🧑‍💻</h1>\n<p>In pairs, can you create a fishbone diagram for the COVID-19 outbreak.
