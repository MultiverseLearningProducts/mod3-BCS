Frameworks are abstract structures to help support our understand of complex systems. Frameworks give us:

*   Labels
*   Patterns
*   Incomes and outcomes

Like a recipe is only a representation of a dish that you could make, a framework is also just a recipe for an outcome. Our task in the module is to learn the labels, learn the patterns, understand the outputs of the SDLC and apply it to our own experiences.

## Learn these

*   Feasibility Study
*   Requirements Engineering
*   Design
*   Development
*   Testing
*   Implementation
*   Maintenance

Memorise these 7 stages of the SDLC. You will see variations of these on-line and in literature. These are the 7 terms that BCS use so we are going to use them.

## Inputs & Outputs

What follows is a brief overview of the different inputs and outputs for each stage of the SDLC. At the end of this module you should be able to:

*   Recognise that there are several ways to represent the terminology and stages of the SDLC.
*   Describe the role of the SDLC in the context of developing of IT systems and services, and operational software end-products.
*   Explain the purpose of the SDLC as a means to facilitate the creation of effective software.
