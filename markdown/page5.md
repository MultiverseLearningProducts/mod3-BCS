> A context diagram defines a boundary between the system, or part of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it.

## Practise UML

Can you create the following diagrams in plantUML

*   A Use Case diagram for Applied
*   An Activity Diagram for checking a hashed password upon signin
*   A Sequence Diagram for authenticating a frontend with a social sign on provided by Facebook
*   A Relational Data Model (your best guess) at version 0.1.0 of Deliveroo
