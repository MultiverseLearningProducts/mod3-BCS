# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The function of the SDLC is to translate business requirements through a structured set of processes to operational IT systems.

The role of the SDLC is to remove the unpredictable “human element” and replace it with structured and managed processes. This makes possible the construction of larger more complex IT systems.

It is important to appreciate that the essence of this module is internalising the formula and systems for creating mission impact with software. It’s going to make you a professional software engineer with savvy business awareness.

Whilst we learn about these abstract ideas and concepts it is essential that you make them come to life by applying them back to your own experiences and business environment.
